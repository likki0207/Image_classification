# Image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset
Image Classification is a fundamental task that attempts to comprehend an entire image as a whole. The goal is to classify the image by assigning it to a specific label. Typically, Image Classification refers to images in which only one object appears and is analyzed. In contrast, object detection involves both classification and localization tasks, and is used to analyze more realistic cases in which multiple objects may exist in an image.
## About the dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.
